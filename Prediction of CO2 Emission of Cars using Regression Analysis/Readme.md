<h1> Prediction of CO2 Emission of cars using regression Analysis.</h1>
< h2> About the datset </h2>
<p>Co2 emission of vehicles are way to bigger than before. This dataset is a simple data that is having independent variables WEIGHT , VOLUME and model of cars . By Using Linear regression models we can predict the amount of CO2emitted by cars per unit volume and weight .</p>
